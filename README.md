# Bank_Accounts

## Overview
### This is a mini-project I have completed using the Codedex specific. I have decided to take the initial task specification and add extra features such as:

* Menu option.
* View, deposit and withdraw function.
* A PIN verification for withdrawals.
* Messages for the user to create a banking app like experience.

### Here's what the original specification looked like:
